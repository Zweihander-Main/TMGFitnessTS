### Tech stack:

-   TypeScript
-   React Native
-   React Navigation
-   Styled Components
-   React Hooks + Redux
-   Expo (bare workflow, not managed)

### Instructions

1. Run `npm install` in the main directory (package.json should be accurate)
    - Special Notes:
        - Source/Dev: `src` folder
2. Run one of the commands from the [Scripts](#scripts) section. You'll most likely want `npm run start` followed by `npm run android` or `npm run ios` depending on what platform you have available

### Scripts

-   `npm run start`: Start metro bundler
-   `npm run android`: Create and serve Android build
-   `npm run ios`: Create and serve iOS build

### Current TODOs:

-   Update libraries when applicable to support web

### Dev notes

-   Changed the folder structure for more sane Styled Components integration
-   Using proper `react-native-calendars` library rather than TMG fork
-   React Native web not currently supported -- waiting on library updates
